Create a new tab called "Advertising" within the existing Masterprompt application.

Instructions:
Create the Advertising Tab:

Add a new menu item labeled "Advertising" in the main navigation bar.

Ensure the tab is visible alongside existing functionalities (e.g., Movie Tools, Image Tools).

Tab Structure:

The Advertising tab should have a three-step process:

Marketing Brief (Strategic Input)

Creative Execution (Visual Settings)

Preview and Generate

Marketing Brief (Step 1):

Create a form with the following fields:

Purpose: Text input (e.g., "Promote a product")

Target Audience: Text input (e.g., "Young professionals")

Core Message: Text input (e.g., "Brewed with Passion. Served with Love.")

Tone and Mood: Dropdown (e.g., Inviting, Professional, Luxurious)

Call to Action: Text input (e.g., "Visit our café today!")

Essential Information: Multi-line text input (e.g., dates, website, contact)

Format and Size: Text input with auto-suggestion (e.g., "Instagram Story (1080x1920)")

Special Requirements: Text input (e.g., logo placement)

Creative Execution (Step 2):

Allow users to choose between Simple and Advanced modes:

Simple:

Upload buttons for Logo and Product Image

Color picker for Brand Colors

Dropdown for Design Style (e.g., Minimalist, Vintage, Cinematic)

Dropdown for Image Style (Aesthetic) (e.g., Ghibli, Realistic, Cyberpunk)

Advanced:

Additional fields for Lighting, Composition, Props, Focus Points

Text input for Post-Processing Preferences

Text input for Action or Pose

Preview and Generate (Step 3):

Display the generated prompt in a text box (editable).

Display the generated image with a download option.

Add a button "Generate Again" to revise with the same brief.

Automatic Format Recognition:

Implement logic to auto-fill dimensions based on common terms (e.g., "Instagram Story" → "1080x1920").

Show dimension suggestions as the user types.

Styling:

Follow the existing design language (neon accents: #FF6A00, #00E5FF).

Use glowing neon icons for buttons and options.

Make the interface clean and intuitive, similar to current Masterprompt tabs.

Backend Integration:

Use ChatGPT API to generate text prompts based on brief input.

Use image_gen API for creating visual outputs.

Store uploaded logos and images securely (e.g., AWS S3).

Link to the existing user database to maintain account consistency.
