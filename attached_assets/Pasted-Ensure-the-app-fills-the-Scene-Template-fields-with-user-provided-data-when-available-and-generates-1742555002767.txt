Ensure the app fills the Scene Template fields with user-provided data when available, and generates accurate AI-suggested content when fields are left blank.

Extraction Rules for Scene Template Fields
If a user does not provide information for a specific field in the Scene Template, the app should:

Analyze the Scene Description

Extract relevant keywords, emotions, and visual cues to generate appropriate values.
Follow These Field-Specific Rules:

Field-Specific Extraction Rules

Technical Implementation Notes for Developers
✅ Prioritize user-provided data; never overwrite it.
✅ Use natural language processing (NLP) to identify keywords for inference.
✅ Ensure Scene Template Fields update dynamically when the Scene Description is modified.
✅ Auto-generated entries should include a tooltip or label that states:

"AI-generated suggestion based on scene description. Click to edit."
