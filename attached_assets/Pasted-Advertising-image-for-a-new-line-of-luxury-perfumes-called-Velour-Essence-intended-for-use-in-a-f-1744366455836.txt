📌 Objective: Promote the sensual and luxurious nature of the “Velour Essence” fragrance line.

🎯 Target Audience: Affluent women aged 25–40 who value elegance, self-expression, and premium self-care products.

💬 Core Message: “Unveil your essence. Wrap yourself in velvet.”

📍 Format & Size: Instagram Story (1080x1920), with room for logo and slogan.

🎨 Visual Style: Cinematic realism with elements of glamour. Inspired by modern fragrance campaigns.

✨ Tone & Mood: Sensual, elegant, sophisticated.

🧱 Composition & Framing: Medium close-up, low-angle view. Subject positioned slightly off-center (rule of thirds), with elegant space above her head for logo placement. Background softly blurred to emphasize subject and product.

💡 Lighting: Soft golden key light from a high left angle (simulating late afternoon sunlight), gentle fill from warm practicals (crystal sconces) in the room. Background highlights glimmer on reflective surfaces.

🧍‍♀️ Model Involvement: A woman in her late 20s with glowing skin and defined cheekbones. She has her eyes closed, inhaling deeply while holding the perfume bottle near her collarbone — portraying a private moment of indulgence.

🎬 Action or Pose: She lifts the bottle toward her face with grace, a subtle smile of satisfaction forming. Steam-like aura subtly glows around her in soft focus.

📸 Focus Points: The bottle in her hand, the shimmer on her skin, and the gentle arch of her lashes. The background includes soft reflections from a vintage mirror and the glow of a crystal sconce.

🛠️ Props & Visual Elements: A glass vanity table in the foreground holds scattered beauty accessories (brushes, gold jewelry, petals), a reflective surface beneath the perfume bottle. In the background, a vintage mirror and candle-lit ambiance add depth and elegance.

🪄 Post-Processing Style: Smooth skin texture with gentle cinematic bloom. Slight vignette around the edges to draw the eye inward. Color palette of soft blacks, muted golds, deep burgundy accents. Minor grain and glow to replicate high-end commercial print finish.

- Use of brand color palette: #A1866F (velvet taupe), #FCEBD2 (champagne gold), and #1A1A1A (deep black).
