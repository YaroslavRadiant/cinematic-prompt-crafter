To improve the cinematic prompt generation system in the app, implement the following enhancements specifically for:

1. Adding Emotional Depth Through Body Language and Micro-Expressions
✅ Develop logic that analyzes the emotional tone implied in the user's description and auto-generates corresponding body language and micro-expressions.
✅ Ensure body language is subtle yet impactful, aligning with professional cinematic standards.
✅ Introduce gestures and physical behavior that reinforce emotional context — examples include:

Emotion	Body Language / Micro-Expression Examples
Anxiety	Fingers tapping rhythmically on a table, shifting weight nervously, a darting gaze
Curiosity	Eyes wide, slightly parted lips, head tilting forward slightly
Fear	Shoulders drawn up, arms tightly crossed, trembling fingers
Sadness	Downcast eyes, slow blinking, lips pressed tightly
Confidence	Chin raised, shoulders back, steady gaze
✅ Automatically integrate these gestures and details in a natural, cinematic manner.
✅ When users describe emotional states vaguely (e.g., "worried," "hopeful"), the system should intelligently choose appropriate gestures and facial cues to match.

2. Enhancing Lighting for Cinematic Impact
✅ Create logic that enhances lighting descriptions based on the mood, time of day, and environment in the scene.
✅ Implement automated lighting selection to balance natural and artificial sources with specific techniques like:

Low-key lighting for suspense, tension, or mystery
Soft diffused light for moments of warmth or introspection
Harsh, directional light to highlight conflict or emotional intensity
Golden hour tones for nostalgia or romance
✅ Ensure lighting descriptions reflect key cinematic techniques such as:

Mood/Emotion	Recommended Lighting Style
Intimate, Warm	Soft ambient lighting with warm tones, candles, or sunset hues
Mysterious, Tense	Low-key lighting with sharp contrasts and deep shadows
Melancholy, Reflective	Natural backlighting, silhouettes, and minimal fill light
Joyful, Vibrant	Bright natural daylight, clean highlights
✅ The app should analyze the described location and environment to suggest appropriate light sources (e.g., window light, streetlights, candles, etc.).

3. Prompt Example After Improvements
If the user describes:

"A girl sits quietly on her bed, looking out the window."

The improved generated prompt should expand this into a rich cinematic description:

Cinematic, Drama Photography, A teenage girl, around 16, with loose, unkempt dark hair framing her face, dressed in an oversized sweater and worn jeans, her expression distant and pensive, Sitting cross-legged on her unmade bed, fingers fidgeting with a thread on her sleeve, her gaze lost out the window as if recalling a distant memory, Medium Shot, Eye Level, Positioned on the right third of the frame with space toward the window for visual tension, Set in a modest bedroom with faded wallpaper peeling at the edges, cluttered with books and scattered clothes, a poster of a forgotten band peeling from the wall, A chipped ceramic mug sits on the windowsill in the foreground, catching the dim evening light, Inspired by Emmanuel Lubezki, Shot on ARRI Alexa Mini, Cooke S4 50mm lens, Kodak Vision3 500T, Soft twilight light filtering through thin curtains, blending warm hues of fading sunlight with the cool glow of a distant streetlamp, The room's corners are cloaked in shadow, heightening the sense of isolation, A muted color palette dominated by pale blues and greys with subtle amber tones from the evening glow, A naturalistic, documentary-inspired aesthetic, Quiet and introspective, her slow breathing and restless fingers conveying uncertainty, Sharp focus on the girl’s face, her reflection faintly visible in the window glass, The rough texture of the worn-out bedding and the chipped mug reinforcing the room's quiet sadness, --ar 16:9 --style raw

4. Code Logic Instructions for Replit.com
✅ Modify the OpenAI API integration to dynamically analyze text in the Description field.
✅ Implement conditions that:

Detect emotional cues (e.g., sadness, tension, fear) and automatically describe relevant body language or gestures.
Adjust lighting parameters based on the described environment or mood.
Prioritize precise visual cues instead of generic statements like "wearing appropriate attire" or "reflecting their emotional state."
✅ Create a conditional logic map to connect detected emotions with suitable gestures and lighting types.
✅ Ensure the system generates all descriptions in one continuous prompt format for compatibility with MidJourney.
