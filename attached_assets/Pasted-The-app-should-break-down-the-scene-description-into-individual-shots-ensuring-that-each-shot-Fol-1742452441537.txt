The app should break down the scene description into individual shots, ensuring that each shot:

Follows professional cinematic storytelling principles.
Aligns with established rules of continuity, visual logic, and emotional flow.
Reflects consistent visual elements from the generated Scene Template (location, lighting, color palette, etc.).
Shot Structure for Each Breakdown
Each shot should follow this structure:

Action/Subject Description: Describe the key visual action (e.g., A girl walks away from the camera...).
Shot Type: Specify the shot size (e.g., Wide Shot, Medium Shot, Close-up).
Direction of Movement: Indicate if characters or objects are moving in a specific direction (e.g., Walks away from the camera, Moves left to right, etc.).
Emotional Highlight: Describe key emotional cues if relevant (e.g., Anxious expression, Tense glance, etc.).
Environmental Details/Lighting (from the Scene Template): Ensures continuity with mood, color palette, and atmosphere.
Visual Focus: Specify what the camera prioritizes (e.g., Focus on girl's tense face, Focus on flickering light in distance).
Camera Positioning/Angle: Indicate camera position if critical (e.g., Low Angle, Over-the-shoulder shot).
